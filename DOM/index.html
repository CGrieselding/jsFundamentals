    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!--
        DOM stands for Document Object Model, and is what allows our JavaScript to interact with the HTML & CSS of our page.
        The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScipt can access and update the contents
        of a web page while it is in the browser's window.

        DOM is an object representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript.

        Two Primary Functions of DOM
            1. Making a model of an HTML page
                - When the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory.
                - The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called
                the DOM tree. The DOM is called an "object model" because the DOM tree is made of objects.

            2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
                - The DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, which
                in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.
        
        Usually when working with the DOM tree, we will acess an element we want to work with, and then we will modify,
        or manipulate, it.

        ACCESSING:
            COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING A SINGLE ELEMENT
                - getElementById()
                - querySelector()
            
            COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS
                - querySelectorAll()
                - getElementByClassName()
                - getElemenetByTagName()
        
        MANIPULATING:
            COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH HTML CONTENT:
                - innerHTML -- NOTE: there are no parenthesis after these because they are a property (not a method)
                - textContent
                - createElement
            
            COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES:
                - className / id
                - setAttribute()
                - getAttribute()

    <!-- ! 1 -->

    <p id="testParagraph">Sample Text</p>

    <!-- ! 2 -->

    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <h2 class="sampleClass">Another example</h2>
    <hr/>

    <span id ="spanTest">Hello<span style="display: none">World</span></span> <!--NOTICE: "World" does not display on the page because
                                                                                of the style = "display: none"-->
    <br/>
    <hr/>

    <!-- ! 3 -->
    <button id="clickThis">Click!</button>

    <br/>
    <hr/>

    <!-- ! 4 -->
    <label for="nameInput">Enter your name:</label><br/>
    <input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder="Your Name Here" /> 


    <!--
        We can write JavaScript directly in our HTML page by typing it within a <script>
            tag, similar to how we would write CSS in a <style> tag.
    -->

    <script>
        // now we can write some JavaScript
        console.log('Hello from the script tag!'); // When pulling up the HTML page, you will see this string in the console when you inspec the page
    </script>

    <!--
        What if we want to use an external JavaScript file in this webpage?
    -->

    <script src = "script.js"></script>
